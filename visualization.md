Binning: 1d gives you a histogram, 2d a heat map

sketch data structures

binning is taking groups of data, typically evening spaced or via log scale, and then counting or aggregating in each group to produce a total amount.

constant memory complexity, produce results inrcrementally, send results to client periodically

1. Aggregate data. (isomorphic data)
2. Turn it into a set of visual elements (map really cleanly to react components).
