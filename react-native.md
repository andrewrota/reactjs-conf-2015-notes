# React Native

3 Pillars:

  * Touch Handling
  * Native Components
  * Style and Layout

**Native Components**

There are a lot of really high quality native components that already exist.  People try to reimplement them but they'll never feel as good as native.



**Style and Layout**

Layout impacts so much of UI code.  It's vastly different in the web, in iOS, and in Android.  "Learn once, write anywhere", also for style and layout.
