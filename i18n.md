Locale: language and region combination.

1.002 and 2/1/2015 is ambiguous because it's dependent on where you are.

Formatting is a difficult challenge.

JavaScript has support for some of these.  Intl.NumberFormat, Intl.DateTimeFormat, Intl.Collator in ES5.1 and Node and the intl.js polyfill (for the first two).

`new Intel.NumberFormat().format(1000);`

You don't want to make a new formatter each time you need it.  Also, it's imperative.  In React we would expect `<FormattedNumber value={1000} />`.  React Intl.

**String Messages**

This is a standard syntax:
`"Hello, {name}!"` 
`"You're {age, number} years old."`

Pluralization

    `{num Comments, plural,
    one {#comment}
    other {# comments}
    };`

**Intl Mixin**

Add the mixin at the top level of your React component hierarchy.  Pass i18n metadata down through your app.  You don't have to thread these through props all the way down, the mixin takes care of that.

Format.js - formatjs.io

Using data that exists in the CLDR.

**Future**

They want these libraries in JS: `Intl.MessageFormat` and `Intl.RelativeFormat`
