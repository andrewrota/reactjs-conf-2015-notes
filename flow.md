# Static typing with flow and typescript

Flow and type both have type inferences.

Type annotations add intent.

"Typescript does not understand JSX"

First solution: don't use JSX.  Second Solution: Fork typescript and make it understand JSX.  Third solution: hack.  Wrap JSX with React.jsx("")

ts definition files explain the shape of some external api.

React definition file exists now

Mixins: don't use them.

"Type" for interfaces in flow
